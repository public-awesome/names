## Stargaze Whitelist Generic

Clone of whitelist-updateable but uses String objects instead of Addr objects such that addresses from Ethereum and/or other networks can be stored. 

Description from whitelist-updatable: 
Admin controlled whitelist contract that:

- holds a list of addresses.
- allows to add/remove addresses.
- holds a per address limit.
- throws error if per address limit reached.
