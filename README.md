# Stargaze Names: A Cosmos IBC Name Service

## DUAL LICENSED

The code is this repository is under two licenses. Please make a note of them before forking / copying.

[Name Marketplace](./contracts/marketplace/LICENSE) -- Business source license

[Name Minter](./contracts/name-minter/LICENSE) -- Apache 2.0 license

[SG721 Name](./contracts/sg721-name/LICENSE) -- Apache 2.0 license

## Architecture

Names are stored without the TLD so they can be mapped to _any_ Cosmos address. All names can be resolved to an address that is derived via the same Cosmos key derivation path (118).

When you buy a Stargaze Name, you are really getting a name on _every_ Cosmos chain. Any chain can lookup a name by its local address over IBC. Similarly, any chain can mint a name over IBC that resolves to a local address.

```
bobo -> D93385094E906D7DA4EBFDEC2C4B167D5CAA431A (in hex)
```

Now this can be resolved per chain:

```
bobo.stars -> stars1myec2z2wjpkhmf8tlhkzcjck04w25sc6ymhplz
bobo.cosmos -> cosmos1myec2z2wjpkhmf8tlhkzcjck04w25sc6y2xq2r
```

This architecture enables Stargaze Names to be a truly Interchain name service since it can mint and resolve names for any Cosmos chain.

## Annual Auction

- When a name is minted it is automatically listed in Name Marketplace (x)
- Owner can accept the top bid at any time (x)
- After 1 year, owner has to pay 0.5% of the top bid to keep the name
- If a bid is placed for 4 weeks, name value rises to this value
- If fee is not paid, name is transferred to the bidder
- If there are no bids, there is a minimum fee to keep the name based on the number of characters
- Cap annual fee at X per year

## Initial Fees

```
5+ chars = 500 STARS
4 chars = 5,000 STARS
3 chars = 50,000 STARS
```
